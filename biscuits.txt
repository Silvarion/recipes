Biscuits Recipe

Preheat oven to 425 degrees.
Add flour, sugar, baking powder and salt to a mixing bowl and stir gently. Consider using a sifter to ensure an even mixture.
Create a hole, or well, in the middle of your mixture.
Pour your milk into the hole.
Add the shortening to the flour mixture.
Knead mixture with your hands until all ingredients are incorporated. You may need to add a little more milk to allow the formation of a dough ball.
Flour a cutting board and place the dough ball in the middle.
Knead the ball about 7 or 8 times, then break it in half.
Take one ball half and pat it down until it is about 1/2-inch thick.
Use a biscuit cutter to cut out about 18 biscuits.
Repeat the process with the remaining dough.
Coat baking sheet with a thin layer of shortening to prevent sticking.
Place biscuits onto the baking sheet. Place them close together for softer biscuits and farther apart for a crispier texture.
Bake for about 10 to 14 minutes, or until tops are lightly brown.
